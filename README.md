This counter will maintain the count, even if user changes the value of the fetch.

All of the selected pictures will be displayed on the home page.
User can delete pictures by hovering over the picture, and clicking the delete button. 

//// Refreshing the Home page///

User can refresh the home page, and still see his selected pictures. 
User can return to search page by clicking the + search button as per request. 
Nav bar was omitted, and navigation is achieved by the stated button. 
(I am not sure per request, however if there was a desire for a Nav bar I am happy to add a responsive Nav bar)

///// Removing items from localStorage/////
A button was added to the bottom of the home page, 
allowing to easily remove stored items from user's device.
This button is for convenience purpose AND NOT PART OF THE ASSIGNMENT.

////Personal note/////

I enjoyed this assignment very much and thank you for the opportunity. 
The UI/UX were somewhat kept bear. Most attention was dedicated to functionality.
I hope you enjoy the review.
